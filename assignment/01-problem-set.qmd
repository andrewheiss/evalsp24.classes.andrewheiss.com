## Task 1: Introduce yourself to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse

1. Go the the example page for this week, ["Welcome to R, RStudio, and the tidyverse"](/example/rstudio-tidyverse.qmd), and work through the different primers and videos in the four parts of the page.

    It seems like there's a lot on the page, but they're short and go fairly quickly (especially as you get the hang of the syntax). Also, **I have no way of seeing what you do or what you get wrong or right, and that's totally fine!** If you get stuck and want to skip some (or if it gets too easy), go right ahead and skip them!


## Task 2: Make an RStudio Project

1. Use either RStudio.cloud or RStudio on your computer (preferably RStudio on your computer! [Follow these instructions to get started!](/resource/install.qmd)) to create a new RStudio Project. Refer to the [example page you read in Task 1 for instructions](/example/rstudio-tidyverse.qmd#part-3-rstudio-projects)

2. Create a folder named "data" in the project folder you just made.

3. Download this CSV file and place it in that folder:

    - [{{< fa file-csv >}} `cars.csv`](/files/data/package_data/cars.csv)

4. In RStudio, go to "File" > "New File…" > "Quarto Document…" and click "OK" in the dialog without changing anything.

5. Delete all the placeholder text in that new file and replace it with this:

````{verbatim, indent="    "}

# Learning R

Tell me that you worked through the primers and videos and examples at the example page for this week:

WRITE SOMETHING HERE LIKE "I did all the primers and had the time of my life!" or whatever.


# My first plots

Insert a chunk below and use it to create a scatterplot (hint: `geom_point()`) with diplacement (`displ`) on the x-axis, city MPG (`cty`) on the y-axis, and with the points colored by drive (`drv`).

PUT CHUNK HERE

Insert a chunk below and use it to create a histogram (hint: `geom_histogram()`) with highway MPG (`hwy`) on the x-axis. Do not include anything on the y-axis (`geom_histogram()` will do that automatically for you). Choose an appropriate bin width. If you're brave, facet by drive (`drv`).

PUT CHUNK HERE


# My first data manipulation

Insert a chunk below and use it to calculate the average city MPG (`cty`) by class of car (`class`). This won't be a plot---it'll be a table. Hint: use a combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()`.

PUT CHUNK HERE
````

6. Save the Quarto file with some sort of name (**without any spaces!**)

7. Your project folder should look something like this:

```{r project-structure, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/files/img/assignments/project-structure.png", error = FALSE)
```


## Task 3: Work with R

1. Remove the text that says "PUT CHUNK HERE" and insert a new R code chunk. Either type <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on Windows, or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> on macOS, or use the "Insert Chunk" menu:

```{r insert-chunk-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="19%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/files/img/assignments/insert-chunk-button.png", error = FALSE)
```

2. Follow the instructions for the three chunks of code.

3. Render your document as a PDF or Word file. Use the "Render" menu:

```{r render-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/files/img/assignments/render-button.png", error = FALSE)
```

4. Upload the rendered document to iCollege.

5. `r emoji::emoji("tada")` Party! `r emoji::emoji("tada")`


:::{.callout-tip}

You'll be doing this same process for all your future problem sets. Each problem set will involve a Quarto file. You can either create a new RStudio Project directory for all your work:

```{r single-directory, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/files/img/reference/rproj-one-folder.png", error = FALSE)
```

Or you can create individual projects for each assignment and project:

```{r multiple-directories, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%",}
knitr::include_graphics("/files/img/reference/rproj-multiple-folders.png", error = FALSE)
```
