Hi everyone!

Despite our best efforts, we've had a bit of a COVID outbreak at home, and I unfortunately just tested positive this morning.

So sadly, like last week, there will be **no in-person session tomorrow**. Depending on how I'm feeling, I'll run the in-person lab on Webex again, like last week. I'll make that call tomorrow afternoonâ€”I'll let you all know by 2 PM. 

So **no** in-person stuff tomorrow evening, but **maybe** synchronous online stuff tomorrow evening.
