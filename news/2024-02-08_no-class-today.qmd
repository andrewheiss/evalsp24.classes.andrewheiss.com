Hi everyone!

I was hoping I'd be able to run the in-class lab this evening over Webex, but lol nope. I'm wiped out and can barely talk.

This sucks because we were going to talk about important DAG stuff and answer all your questions about causal models and do an activity where we created both a logic model and a DAG for a program (since they're very different things with different purposes). We'll do that all next week instead.

Accordingly, I've changed the deadline for the causal model assignment that would be due next week. In order to give you time to get your questions answered about DAGs, **the causal model assignment is due on February 22 now**. I've changed the deadline on the class website and on iCollege.
