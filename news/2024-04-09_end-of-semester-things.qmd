Hi everyone!

A few quick important announcements for these last few weeks of the semester:

- I (finally!) just updated your grades for everything turned in to iCollege so far. Please check your grades to make sure I'm not missing anything!
- You can still turn stuff in late! I've been, like, super lenient about late penalties (despite what I said in the syllabus), so you can still make up missing work
- You can turn work in up until **Friday, April 26 at 11:59 PM**—the Friday before the final project is due. That's the final final deadline for all assignments that aren't the final project.

And remember, *please* reach out for help if you're struggling! Don't suffer in silence—I'm here to help you!
