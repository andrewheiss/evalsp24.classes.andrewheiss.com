## Readings

- {{< fa book >}} Chapters 3 and 4 in *The Effect* [@Huntington-Klein:2021]


## Recommended readings

Look through your notes on regression from your last stats class. Also, you can skim through these resources:

- {{< fa book >}} [5.1–5.4 in *ModernDive*](https://moderndive.com/5-regression.html) [@IsmayKim:2018]
- {{< fa book >}} [6.1–6.4 in *ModernDive*](https://moderndive.com/6-multiple-regression.html) [@IsmayKim:2018]
- {{< fa book >}} 7.1–7.3 in *OpenIntro Statistics* [@DiezBarrCetinkaya-Rundel:2017]
- {{< fa book >}} 8.1 in *OpenIntro Statistics* [@DiezBarrCetinkaya-Rundel:2017]

We'll review all this regression stuff in the videos, so *don't panic* if this all looks terrifying! Also, take advantage of the videos that accompany the *OpenIntro* chapters. And *also*, the *OpenIntro* chapters are heavier on the math—don't worry if you don't understand everything.



## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/02-slides")
slide_tabs(slide_details, "/slides/02-slides.html")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.

## Videos

```{r show-youtube-list, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
youtube_list(slide_details, playlist_id)
```

## Bayesian statistics resources

In class I briefly mentioned the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics. You can see a bunch of [additional resources and examples of these two approaches to statistics here](/resource/bayes.qmd). [This huge blog post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2021/12/01/multilevel-models-panel-data-guide/) also shows how to do multilevel models with Bayesian models.
