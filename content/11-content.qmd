### Instrumental variables

- The [example page on instrumental variables](/example/iv.qmd) shows how to use R to analyze and estimate causal effects with instrumental variables


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/11-slides")
slide_tabs(slide_details, "/slides/11-slides.html")
