## Readings

- {{< fa file-pdf >}} Andrew Heiss, "Causal Inference," Chapter 10 in *R for Political Data Science: A Practical Guide* (2020) (Ignore the exercises!). [Get the PDF here.](/files/10-causal-inference.pdf)
- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 4 in *Impact Evaluation in Practice* [@wb-eval]
- {{< fa book >}} Chapters 11 and 13 in *The Effect* [@Huntington-Klein:2021]. **Focus especially on section 13.3 about standard errors.** And skim chapter 11; it's an overview of regression, which we reviewed in session 2, but it also applies the language of DAGs to regression, so look for that specifically as you read.

### RCTs, matching, and inverse probability weighting

- The [example page on RCTs](/example/rcts.qmd) shows how to use R to analyze and estimate causal effects from RCTs
- The [example page on matching and inverse probability weighting](/example/matching-ipw.qmd) shows how to use R to close backdoors, make adjustments, and find causal effects from observational data using matching and inverse probability weighting


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.
