## Readings

- The [example page on complier average causal effects](/example/cace.qmd) shows how to use R to disentangle complier average causal effects
- The [example page on fuzzy regression discontinuity](/example/rdd-fuzzy.qmd) shows how to use R to use instrumental variables in fuzzy regression discontinuity, both parametrically and nonparametrically


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.
