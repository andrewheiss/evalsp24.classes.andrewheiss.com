## Readings

### Measurement

- {{< fa brands youtube >}} [The witch trial scene from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp_l5ntikaU)
- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 5 in *Evaluation: A Systematic Approach* [@RossiLipseyHenry:2019]. This is available on iCollege.
- {{< fa book >}} Chapter 5 in *The Effect* [@Huntington-Klein:2021]

### DAGs

- {{< fa file-pdf >}} Julia M. Rohrer, "Thinking Clearly About Correlations and Causation: Graphical Causal Models for Observational Data" [@Rohrer:2018] This will be posted on iCollege.
- {{< fa file-pdf >}} Section 2 only (pp. 4–11) from Julian Schuessler and Peter Selb, "Graphical Causal Models for Survey Inference." [@SchuesslerSelb:2019] [The PDF is available at SocArXiv.](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hbg3m/)
- {{< fa book >}} Chapters 6 and 7 in *The Effect* [@Huntington-Klein:2021]

### DAG example page

- The [example page on DAGs](/example/dags.qmd) shows how to draw and analyze DAGs with both dagitty.net and R + {ggdag}


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_buttons("/slides/04-slides")
slide_frame("/slides/04-slides.html")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.

## Videos

```{r show-youtube-list, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
youtube_list(slide_details, playlist_id)
```

## In-class stuff

Here are all the materials we'll use in class:

- [**Session 4 FAQ slides**](/slides/04-class.html) ([PDF](/slides/04-class.pdf))
- [{{< fa brands r-project >}} Regression playground Posit.cloud project](https://posit.cloud/spaces/323551/content/5299495)
- [{{< fa file-zipper >}} Regression playground project `.zip` file](/projects/regression-example.zip)

## Bayesian statistics resources

In class I briefly mentioned the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics. You can see a bunch of [additional resources and examples of these two approaches to statistics here](/resource/bayes.qmd). [This huge blog post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2021/12/01/multilevel-models-panel-data-guide/) also shows how to do multilevel models with Bayesian models.
