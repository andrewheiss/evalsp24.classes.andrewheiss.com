.box-6.large[Why so much content<br>these first two weeks?]

???

Everything is a little scattered at the beginning because you're all coming from different backgrounds and skill levels. Some have been using R for months+years, some haven't. Some have been doing regression and stats for years, some haven't. So these first two weeks involve throwing a bunch of stuff at you and seeing what you'll take and what you need.

In the future, it'll be a lot more consolidated: content on the content page, assignment instructions on the assignments page, example walk through on the examples page. That's it. Content, assignment, example, over and over again.

Show model with `lm()`; show t-test with `t.test()`; show both through `tidy()`

Use **marginaleffects**
